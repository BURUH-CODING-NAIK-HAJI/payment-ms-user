# How to use this template
- in folder log you need to create file with name `error.log`
- copy file `.env.example` and paste on root of this project and name it as `.env`
- replace value of `SERVICE_NAME` in `.env` file same as folder name

# TODO
- [ ] Add Centralized Logging Service, Hope Can Implement ELK Stack
